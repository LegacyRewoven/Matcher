# Matcher

A tool used for matching two jars using a score-based matching system.

Forked from [FabricMC/Matcher](https://github.com/FabricMC/Matcher), a derivative of [sfPlayer1/Matcher](https://github.com/sfPlayer1/Matcher).

### How do I use it

Requires JDK 11.

Build it with `./gradlew build`, run `matcher-all.jar` in `build/libs`. Doesn't work if you launch it from IDE for some reason.
