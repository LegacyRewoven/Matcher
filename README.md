# Matcher

A tool mainly used for matching two Minecraft versions to avoid having to remap everything every time the game updates.

Forked from [FabricMC/Matcher](https://github.com/FabricMC/Matcher), a derivative of [sfPlayer1/Matcher](https://github.com/sfPlayer1/Matcher).

### How do I use it

Build it with `./gradlew build`, run `matcher-all.jar` in `build/libs`. Doesn't work if you launch it from IDE for some reason.
